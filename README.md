# Coding Every Day

##Although, the name suggests that I code everyday, it might not show that I have pushed or updated my repository, however, I do try to code every day which shows on my Hackerrank profile.

### Fair warning! This is my first README.md so it clearly needs work. Thank you, if you took the time to read everything in this README.

This "project" will just be a compilation/collection of small problems that I have solved. It will vary from Data Structures, Algorithm Problem Solving, and just plain general Problem Solving. Most programs will be written in Java/C/C++ and Python/PHP when I get have it to the same level as the others. Depending on when I solved the problem or when I last modified the file, my approach to the problem may be too simple or be improved but it serves as an access point to how far I have come when looking at future problems! Ultimately, this projects serves as an outlet for anyone to see what I have solved.
