# Coding Every Day

Although, the name suggests that I code everyday, it might not show that I have worked on anything, however, I do try to work on something every day.

This repository consists of a compilation/collection of small problems/projects that I have solved. It will vary from Data Structures, Algorithm Problem Solving, and Projects. Most programs will be written in Java/C/C++ and maybe Python/PHP. Depending on when I solved the problem or when I last modified the file, my approach to the problem may be too simple or be improved but it serves as an access point to how far I have come when looking at future problems! Ultimately, this projects serves as an outlet for anyone to see what I have done.
